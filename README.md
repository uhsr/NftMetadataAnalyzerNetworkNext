# NftMetadataAnalyzerNetworkNext

## Description

This repository houses a novel NFT marketplace contract employing a Merkle tree-based ownership verification system for gas-efficient claim processes, alongside a decentralized IPFS pinning service integrated via libp2p for resilient asset storage.

## Features

- Leverages a distributed graph database to efficiently store and query complex NFT metadata relationships.
- Implements a customizable rule engine for automatically detecting and flagging suspicious NFT metadata patterns.
- Deploys a decentralized oracle network to verify off-chain NFT metadata sources for accuracy and consistency.
- Integrates with IPFS and Arweave for permanent storage of NFT metadata and related media files.
- Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict NFT value based on metadata attributes and market trends.
- Offers a GraphQL API for developers to easily access and integrate NFT metadata analysis results into their applications.
- Supports a modular plugin architecture, enabling users to extend the system with custom metadata analysis tools.
- Employs a distributed caching layer using Redis to optimize metadata retrieval performance.
